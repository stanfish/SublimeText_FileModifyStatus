# FileModifyStatus

FileModifyStatus is a Sublime Text plugin that shows the _modified_ status of the file in the status bar. This is done through checking the save status.

Sublime Text itself tells if the document is dirty or not but only since the last save. This plugin however checks if the file has been saved since it was ever opened.

* If the file is modified:

    ![FileModifyStatus][screenshot2]

* If the file is not modified since it was opened:

    ![FileModifyStatus][screenshot1]
